---

## 🔑 Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Get Stripe Test Keys
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`)
3. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)

### 2. Add to `.env.local`
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
```

### 3. Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 Test the Flow

### As a Contractor:

1. **Sign up** at: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
   - Select role: `contractor`
   - Use any test email

2. **Complete Onboarding**
   - Dashboard will show a blue banner
   - Click "Get Started"
   - You'll be redirected to Stripe (use test data)
   - Fill in the form with fake info (test mode)
   - Return to dashboard

3. **Check Vetting Status**
   - Your `vettingStatus` in Firestore will be `pending_stripe`
   - When Stripe approves, it becomes `approved` (via webhook)

4. **Simulate Approval** (For Testing):
   ```bash
   # Use the set-role script or manually update Firestore:
   # Set: users/{uid}/contractorProfile/vettingStatus = "approved"
   ```

5. **Browse Leads**
   - Dashboard now shows "Available Leads"
   - Click "Browse Leads" or "View All"
   - See matched leads (if any exist)

6. **Create Test Lead** (As a Homeowner):
   - Sign up as a homeowner
   - Create a lead (you'll need to build this UI or add via Firestore)
   - Make sure the lead's `matchedContractorIds` includes your contractor ID

7. **Purchase a Lead**
   - Click "Purchase for $XX"
   - Redirected to Stripe Checkout
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future date, any CVC
   - Complete payment

8. **View Lead Details**
   - After successful payment, you'll see full contact info
   - AR assessment results (if available)
   - Homeowner details

## 📝 Firestore Data Structure

### For Testing, Create These Documents:

**Sample User (Contractor):**
```javascript
// Collection: users
// Document ID: {contractorUserId}
{
  email: "contractor@test.com",
  displayName: "Test Contractor",
  role: "contractor",
  contractorProfile: {
    companyName: "Test Contracting Co.",
    vettingStatus: "approved",  // or "pending_stripe", "rejected"
    licenseNumber: "LIC12345",
    insuranceVerified: true,
    capsCertified: false,
    specialties: ["ramp-construction", "bathroom-remodel"],
    serviceAreaZips: ["90210", "90211", "90212"],
    bio: "We specialize in aging-in-place modifications.",
    averageRating: 4.8,
    reviewCount: 12,
    stripeAccountId: "acct_..." // Added after Stripe onboarding
  },
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
}
```

**Sample Lead:**
```javascript
// Collection: leads
// Document ID: auto-generated
{
  homeownerId: "{homeownerUserId}",
  status: "matched",  // new, matching, matched, sold
  urgency: "high",  // low, medium, high
  budgetRange: "$5k-$10k",
  description: "Need to install wheelchair ramp and widen doorways for aging parent.",
  price: 2500,  // in cents ($25.00)
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date(),
  arAssessmentId: "{assessmentId}",  // optional
  
  // Denormalized homeowner info
  homeownerInfo: {
    displayName: "John Doe",
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Beverly Hills",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "90210"
  },
  
  // Contractor matching
  matchedContractorIds: ["{contractorUserId}"],  // Your contractor ID here!
  purchasedBy: [],  // Will populate after purchase
  viewedByContractors: []
}
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before Purchase:
- ✅ Can see lead preview (city, state, description, urgency, budget)
- ❌ Cannot see full address
- ❌ Cannot see homeowner name
- ❌ Cannot see AR assessment

### After Purchase:
- ✅ Full address visible
- ✅ Homeowner contact info shown
- ✅ AR assessment results (if available)
- ✅ Lead added to "Your Purchased Leads" section

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Complete onboarding to view leads"
- Your vetting status is not `approved`
- Either complete Stripe onboarding or manually set it in Firestore

### No leads showing
- Make sure leads exist with status `matched`
- Verify your contractor ID is in the lead's `matchedContractorIds` array
- Check that serviceAreaZips overlap with lead's ZIP code

### Stripe redirect fails
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000` in `.env.local`
- Check Stripe keys are correct
- Ensure dev server is running on port 3000

### Purchase doesn't work
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Stripe publishable key is set
- Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
