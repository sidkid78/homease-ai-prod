## 🎯 How It Works (User Flow)

### For a New Contractor:

1. **Signs up** → Creates account with role `contractor`
2. **Sees onboarding banner** → Dashboard prompts Stripe Connect setup
3. **Clicks "Get Started"** → Redirected to Stripe onboarding
4. **Completes Stripe form** → Returns to dashboard
5. **Webhook fires** → Vetting status updated to `approved`
6. **Dashboard unlocks** → Can now browse and purchase leads

### For an Approved Contractor:

1. **Views dashboard** → Sees new leads count and stats
2. **Clicks "Browse Leads"** → Goes to marketplace
3. **Selects a lead** → Views preview (limited info)
4. **Clicks "Purchase"** → Redirected to Stripe Checkout
5. **Completes payment** → Webhook updates Firestore
6. **Returns to platform** → Can now see full lead details + contact info

- ✅ Vetting status verified before showing leads
- ✅ Stripe webhooks will verify signatures (in Cloud Functions)
- ✅ Lead access controlled by `purchasedBy` array
- ✅ Client-side Stripe keys are public-safe
- ✅ Server-side operations use secure Stripe SDK
